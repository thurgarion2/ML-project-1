# ML-project-1


As asked of us, our submission to the project is composed of several documents listed here:

* The report detailing with as much detail as two pages allow the ins and outs of the project. 

* The script `run.py`, outputting our prediction in `predictions.cvs`. We do not provide the `dataset`, you should download it here : `https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs/dataset_files` and extract `train.csv` and `test.csv` in a folder `dataset`.
* Our functions in `implementations.py`.
* Our Source code `ML project 1.ipynb`.
